# Collected challenges and ideas

- Each program line and block set a comment inside code
- I don't hide everything I see
- Use an image for Docker/Podman to download all necessary components and build the application
- Use the virtual environment <https://www.qemu.org> to create the programs
- Sources for use the virtual environment with RISC/V
  - <https://duckduckgo.com/?q=How+stable+is+Platforms%2FRISCV&t=vivaldi&atb=v484-7&ia=web>
  - <https://risc-v-getting-started-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>
- Test case <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testfall>
  - Full code coverage at 100%
  - Complete alignment with the evaluation of test coverage
  - For every positive test, a negative test
  - Testing all inputs and outputs

  <!-- TODO: Add more test scenarios for edge cases -->
  - [ ] Review test coverage for all modules
  - [ ] Add negative test cases for input validation
  - [ ] Ensure all outputs are verified in tests

## Topics for later

- arch Linux
- Linux from scratch
